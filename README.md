This assignment reqiures students to build a basic multiple choice question that counts down from a time
and adds points for correct answers, but users lose points for either not answering or answering incorrectly. Users can also lose time remaining for each wrong answer (10 sec loss).

***ORIGINAL ASSIGMENT***
``
As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.```

***GIVEN USER STORY***
```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

*** ORIGINAL ASSIGNMENT PART 2***
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

***UNQIUE ASPECTS OF THIS GAME***
The game starts with 75 seconds to answer 5 multiple choice questions. If you answer a question incorrectly, you lose 10 seconds. If the timer wrongs out before you answer all the questions you should try again. If you complete the quiz with all the correct answers within the time period... well then... YOU ARE AWESOME!!!
