# Code-Quiz
Come visit [THIS SITE](https://mathcodes.github.io/Test-your-Coding-Skills-/index.html) to test your skills by taking a basic multiple choice QUIZ that counts down from a time
and adds points for correct answers. Users lose points for either not answering or answering incorrectly. Users can also lose time remaining for each wrong answer.
``

## DETAILS
The game starts with 75 seconds to answer 5 multiple choice questions. If you answer a question incorrectly, you lose 10 seconds. If the timer wrongs out before you answer all the questions you should try again. If you complete the quiz with all the correct answers within the time period... well then... YOU ARE AWESOME!!!

***REVIEW***
